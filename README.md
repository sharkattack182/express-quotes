# Express Quotes

## Purpose
This was really just to practice using express handlebars. I have been experienting with different databases and wanted to practice mySql queries. This was a good example of using multiple templates depending on the request. 

## Process
The iea was relativley basic. Most of the tedious work was already done including building and styling the various handlebar files as well as the jquery used to handle the events. I was really only responsible for writting out the various routes needed. It was basically just practicing using the various CRUD operations and navigating the various express templates.
